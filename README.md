### Hi, Iâ€™m Merlin ðŸ‘‹

I build digital products that work for humans and businesses.

I have a T-shaped skill set with a deep understanding of the frontend stack and a broad understanding of product design and UX, backend engineering, devops and infrastructure, project and people management, business operations, security and compliance.

Most recently (2014 - 2021), I co-founded and led engineering at Mo(https://mo.work), building a 12 strong engineering team and a product used by 100,000 users from scratch. With a small team we created a product that would often win over industry incumbents (Yammer, Reward Gateway, Perkbox) in sales processes.

As well as being very hands on with our product and engineering, other highlights included: 
- Successfully raising multiple rounds of investment including Series A with multiple VCTs. 
- Leading the company through the ISO27001 compliance process.
- In an independent audit by Intechnica, commissioned as due diligence by incoming investors, our engineering team was described as "excellent" and an "enabler for the business".
