### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Merlin (he/him). I'm passionate about building the teams, processes and software that create amazing digital products.

I have a T-shaped skill set with a deep understanding of the frontend stack and a broad understanding of product design and UX, backend engineering, devops and infrastructure, project and people management, business operations, security and compliance.

Most recently (2014 - 2021), I co-founded and led engineering at Mo, building a 12 strong engineering team and a product used by 100,000 users from scratch. With a small team we created a product that would often win over industry incumbents (Yammer, Reward Gateway, Perkbox etc) in sales processes.

This included:
- Lead engineer on the frontend application, remaining hands on alongside CTO duties.
- Took the company through the ISO27001 compliance process.
- In an independent audit by Intechnica, commissioned as due diligence by incoming Series A investors, our engineering team was described as "excellent" and an "enabler for the business".
